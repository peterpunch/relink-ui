# Relink UI

## Project Overview
**Relink UI** is a React-based front-end application designed to simplify the process of creating and managing shortened links. The application allows users to input a long URL, transform it into a short link through a back-end API, and retrieve the generated link to share with others.

The project leverages modern web technologies like React, TypeScript, and Vite, offering a high-performance and developer-friendly environment.

---

## Features
- **Short Link Generation**: Quickly transform long URLs into short, shareable links.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Support for redirecting users based on short links.
- **Interactive UI**: A visually intuitive interface with seamless user experience.
- **Efficient Development**: Modern tools like TypeScript and Vite ensure improved code quality and performance.
- **API Integration**: Communicates with a back-end API to provide core URL shortening functionality.

## Prerequisites
Ensure your system has the following installed before running the project:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

---

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```shell script
git clone <repository_url>
   cd relink-ui
```


2. Install required dependencies:
```shell script
npm install
```


3. Start the development server:
```shell script
npm run dev
```

The development server will run the application on `http://localhost:5173` by default.

4. Ensure the back-end API is running on `http://localhost:8080` to allow URL shortening functionality.

## File Structure
The project files are organized as follows:

```
relink-ui/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                    # Core source code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/             # Static assets such as images or fonts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx             # Main React component to bootstrap the application
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.css             # Styling for the main React component
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.tsx            # Entry point for rendering the root application
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ CreateShortLinkPage.tsx # Component for the URL creation page
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ RedirectShortLinkPage.tsx # Component for handling short link redirection
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.css           # Global styles for the application
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ vite-env.d.ts       # Vite environment types
â”œâ”€â”€ public/                 # Static public assets
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json            # Project configuration and scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json           # TypeScript configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ vite.config.ts          # Vite configuration file
```


### Notable Files:
- **`CreateShortLinkPage.tsx`**: Define the user interface and logic for creating shortened links.
- **`RedirectShortLinkPage.tsx`**: A page dedicated to handling short link-specific redirects.
- **`App.tsx` & `main.tsx`**: Bootstrap the application and handle routing.

---

## Running in Production
To create a production-ready build of the project, run:
```shell script
npm run build
```

The optimized files will be output in the `dist/` directory. These can be deployed to any static hosting provider.

---

## Linting the Code
To maintain code quality and adhere to coding standards, lint the project using:
```shell script
npm run lint
```


---

## API Integration
The app interacts with a back-end URL shortening API. Ensure the API is available at `http://localhost:8080` for the app to function correctly.

### API Endpoint:
- **POST** `/relink/api/short-links`
    - **Request Body**: `{ "url": "your-long-url" }`
    - **Response**: `{ "hash": "generated-short-link-hash" }`

The generated short links are structured as `http://localhost:5173/<hash>`.
